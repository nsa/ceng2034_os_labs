# Final lab
-----------------------------
You have a chunk of files (mixed png, jpeg, txt). But these files have no extension.
- Categorize the files according to their types. (copy or move each of them to different folders such as jpegFolder, pngFolder, txtFolder...)
- Use concurrency methodology to do this job more faster.
- Do a benchmark to show the difference between single thread and multi thread.

There are 4 types of files in files directory: 
- file1 jpg
- file2 mp3
- file3 png
- file4 ASCI txt 
(other 140 files are mixed of them. You can look over copyScript.py for how i do that.)
